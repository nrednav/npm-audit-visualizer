```

## Usage

Navigate to a project that has package vulnerabilities and generate an audit
report:

```shell
npm audit --json > audit.json
```

Then, run the tool on the generated audit report:

```shell
npm-audit-visualizer -f audit.json
```

By default, this should automatically open a new page in your web browser at the

manually.

## About

### What

`npm-audit-visualizer` is a web-based tool to visualize audit reports generated
by `npm audit`.

### Why

With v7 of npm, the `npm audit` command was updated & it no longer displays
results in a tabular format.

While the new format is still useful, there were some visual elements to the old
tabular format that made it easier to trace vulnerability paths & dependencies.

As a result, the goal of this tool is to re-provide a visual interface for audit
reports, which can hopefully make it quicker and easier to identify and resolve
vulnerabilities within npm-managed projects.
