## Usage

Navigate to a project that has package vulnerabilities and generate an audit
report:

```shell
npm audit --json > audit.json
```

Then, run the tool on the generated audit report:

```shell
npm-audit-visualizer -f audit.json
```

By default, this should automatically open a new page in your web browser at the
URL: `http://localhost:1248`. If it does not, please try navigating to that URL
manually.

## About

### What

`npm-audit-visualizer` is a web-based tool to visualize audit reports generated
by `npm audit`.

### Why

With v7 of npm, the `npm audit` command was updated & it no longer displays
results in a tabular format.

While the new textual format still contains useful information, there were
visual elements to the tabular format that made it slightly easier to trace the
vulnerability paths & dependencies.

The goal of this tool is to supplement the current output of `npm audit` with a
visual interface, that can hopefully make the process of identifying & resolving
vulnerabilities within npm projects, quicker & easier.
